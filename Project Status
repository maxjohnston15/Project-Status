Ren'Py Short Story

***

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have downloaded Ren'Py and watched tutorials on how to operate the system. I have begun to make a dialogue for my script
and included "jump" statements that will take my story through different scenes. I have also included a choice option to
accomplish my goals of having the story/game be interactive. I am considering changing my script to a strictly math game
because I think I can visualize a better plot, but if I can make my current story work then I will continue with it.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not downloaded images, backgrounds, or music to my computer so even though they are included in my script, they are not
actually calling on any real downloads on my computer.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Other than a lack of experience with the program I am doing okay.
